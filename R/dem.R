#' Build a document-embedding matrix
#'
#' Given a document-feature-matrix, for each document,
#' multiply its feature counts (columns) with their
#' corresponding pretrained word embeddings and average
#' (usually referred to as averaged or additive document embeddings).
#' If specified and a transformation matrix is provided,
#' multiply the document embeddings by the transformation matrix
#' to obtain the corresponding `a la carte` document embeddings.
#' (see eq 2: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.05388.pdf)
#'
#' @param x a quanteda (`dfm-class`) document-feature-matrix
#' @param pre_trained (numeric) a F x D matrix corresponding to pretrained embeddings.
#' F = number of features and D = embedding dimensions.
#' rownames(pre_trained) = set of features for which there is a pre-trained embedding.
#' @param transform (logical) if TRUE (default) apply the 'a la carte' transformation,
#' if FALSE ouput untransformed averaged embeddings.
#' @param transform_matrix (numeric) a D x D 'a la carte' transformation matrix.
#' D = dimensions of pretrained embeddings.
#' @param verbose (logical) - if TRUE, report the documents that had
#' no overlapping features with the pretrained embeddings provided.
#'
#' @return a N x D (`dem-class`) document-embedding-matrix corresponding to the ALC embeddings for each document.
#' N = number of documents (that could be embedded), D = dimensions of pretrained embeddings. This object
#' inherits the document variables in `x`, the dfm used. These can be accessed calling the attribute: `@docvars`.
#' Note, documents with no overlapping features with the pretrained embeddings provided are automatically
#' dropped. For a list of the documents that were embedded call the attribute: `@Dimnames$docs`.
